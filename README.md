##A File Explorer Which is Content Searchable ( With Auto suggestion )

The idea is to write down a sophisticated file explorer with searchable content feature archive

achievable features.

* 1. Searchable Contents

Searchable Content e.g searching inside pdf files, word files, text files etc from explorer. The contents

will be indexed and made searchable via single point. Every update will dynamically added to available

search data. THE EFFICENCY OF SEARCH WILL BE THE PRIME PROBLEM.

* 2. Archive Feature

Contents should be archived from intervals. It is not very hard to see that files used today will be less

usable 2 months after unless we still working on that project actively or we come back to the project

after a while. The file explorer will decide on access times of searching and prioritize those who are

recently used.

* 3. Email Searching

Add your email settings and get your emails searchable in file explorer.

* 4. Shortcut Searching

It will keep track of exe so if someone writes corel he will get link to corel executable or as window

search does.
